# Autonomous vehicle project
VHDL - VHSIC Hardware Description Language

As part of the course in logical design, we completed a project where we built a small autonomous vehicle connected to the FPGA that uses the VHDL code and is able to travel different routes, illuminate in different shapes, make different sounds and rotate a fan attached to its roof.

For this purpose, we were divided into groups and each group was responsible for a different part of the project:

Team A - Input unit and track generator.

Team B- Four-wheel controller.

Team C- Display and Sound Generators.

Team D-Engine Controller at varying speeds.

Test Bench Team

After each team has completed its task in the project we came together to connect all the components and then to the project presentation session.
